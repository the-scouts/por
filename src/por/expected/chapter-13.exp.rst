This Rule applies in England and Wales only.

a. All Scout Units are independent charities.

   *  their income is more than £100,000, or
   *  they have permanent endowment (a rare interest in land/building or other assets which cannot be spent as 'income') and their income is £5,000 or over; or
   *  they own land or buildings and their income is £5,000 or over

      However, it is important to note that even excepted and unregistered charities still remain subject to general charity law and the rules of the Charity Commission which may investigate matters where there is proper cause for concern.
