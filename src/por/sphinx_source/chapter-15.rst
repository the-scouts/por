Rule 15.2 Suspension of adult Members, Associate Members and non-Members
------------------------------------------------------------------------
a. The following also applies to Members of the Scout Network.
b. Suspension of any involvement in Scouting by a Member, Associate Member or a non-Member is an act intended to protect all persons involved. It assists to ensure that any investigation or inquiry proceeds in as fair and objective manner as possible by preventing situations arising which could give rise to further concerns/allegations or which could potentially cause further compromise.

   Suspension is permitted in the following circumstances:

   i. when an allegation is made that an individual involved in Scouting has committed a serious criminal offence. In this case the individual must be suspended until police inquiries and/or any legal proceedings have been concluded;
   ii. when a disagreement or dispute between adults remains unresolved for a period of more than 30 days (commencing from when a formal written notification of the dispute is provided to the relevant Executive Committee), suspension in this case is to be for a period of not more than 90 days in the first instance. Suspension for further periods of not more than 90 days may follow and must be communicated to the suspended individual;
   iii. if a Member or Associate Member makes a formal, public challenge (to a non-Scouting organisation, body or forum) against the decision or policy of either:

        *  a local Executive Committee of a Scout unit (of which that Member or Associate Member is a member)

           and/or

        *  The Scout Association

           where such public challenge seeks to change, overturn or reverse the said decision or policy or causes adverse publicity about the same.

   iv. where the intentional action or inaction of an individual involved in Scouting could seriously harm the reputation of the Movement.

   v. when the action of an individual involved in Scouting may constitute gross misconduct

   vi. where an individual involved in Scouting requiring a Criminal Record Disclosure Check for their role in Scouting does not hold such a disclosure and a period of 30 days (where an electronic system is used) or 60 days (where a paper based system is used) has expired since one was held or required.

c. In every case Membership may be suspended only by the appropriate authority with approval from the other appropriate authority as defined in the following table:

* Note that the inclusion of Scout Network Members at Area (Wales), County (England and Northern Ireland) and Region (Scotland) is to deal with exceptions where provision of Scout Network is provided at a level other than the District.

      ii. all modifications must be agreed with the authority that approved the suspension as defined in Rule 15.2c.
      iii. the modifications must be kept to a minimum and are only to enable the suspended person as parent or carer to participate to some extent in Scouting with their child (for example, to attend award presentations or to drop off and pick-up the child).
      iv. The modifications must not compromise the safety and wellbeing of youth members.
      v. Where Rule 15.2b (vi) applies, the modifications must not allow the suspended individual to engage in regulated activity.

n. When reviewing a suspension and making the subsequent recommendation those responsible must follow a similar process as used when appointing adults and give the same considerations as to the suitability of the individual to carry out a specific role, i.e. they must satisfy themselves that the subject continues to be an appropriate person for a particular appointment.

o. The suspended person must be informed in writing of the decision which ends a period of suspension and in each case a record of the discussions and outcomes must be documented and forwarded to the Vetting Team at Headquarters.

Rule 15.3 Safeguarding Stay-Away
--------------------------------
a. Stay-Away is a tool that can be used by the national Safeguarding team only. Stay-Away of any involvement in Scouting by a Member (including Scout Network), Associate Member or a non-Member is an act intended to protect all persons involved. It exists to ensure that any investigation or inquiry proceeds in as fair and objective manner as possible by preventing situations arising which could give rise to further concerns/allegations or which could potentially cause further compromise.

Stay-Away is permitted in the following circumstances:

   1. when an allegation is made that an individual involved in Scouting has behaved in a way that may be considered a breach of the The Scouts Safeguarding Policy Statement and/or the Code of conduct set out in the Yellow Card;
   2. When a concern is raised in regards to an individual involved in Scouting that may suggest that they are unsuitable to be in a Position of Trust with young people;

   4. Where information is received from a statutory agency in regard to concerns raised about an individual involved in Scouting.

b. Where at the point of referral to the safeguarding team there is;

   1. Insufficient information to make a decision to suspend or not
   2. Disputed information to make a clear decision
   3. Inconsistent information to make a decision to suspend or not

c. In such circumstances the Safeguarding Team in consultation with the relevant Commissioner will agree that the individual should Stay-Away from all Scouting activities for a period of two weeks. The following processes must occur;

Rule 15.4 Suspension of Beaver Scouts, Cub Scouts, Scouts or Explorer Scouts
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
a. Formal suspension of a youth member may be appropriate where they have been accused of a serious criminal offence or of behaviour that put adults or young people at serious risk of harm. See also the factsheet Guidance on the formal suspension of youth members.

b. Suspension is not a disciplinary sanction or an indication of guilt but ensures that no situation can arise that may cause further concern and allows a period where further information may be received and if appropriate the statutory agencies (typically the police or social services) may carry out their duties.

c. The District Commissioner has the authority to suspend a young person. However wherever possible they should act in consultation with the relevant Group Scout Leader / Explorer Scout Leader.

d. Before suspending a young person, District Commissioners should consult their County Commissioner and must inform the Country HQ.

g. The parents / carers of the youth member must be informed of their suspension in writing and given a copy of the information sheet Notes for the parents /carers for the young person.

Rule 15.5 Ending a period of Suspension of Beaver Scouts, Cub Scouts, Scouts or Explorer Scouts
