<section id="rule-4-7-explorer-scout-units">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#rule-4-7-explorer-scout-units">Rule 4.7 Explorer Scout Units</a></h2>
<ol class="loweralpha">
<li>Explorer Scout Units are part of a District’s provision of Scouting.</li>
<li>Explorer Scout Units may be attached to a Scout Group but are not a formal part of the Group.</li>
<li>An Explorer Scout Unit consists of a number of Explorer Scouts.</li>
<li>They may be divided into smaller groups but these should be flexible.</li>
<li>All Explorer Scout Units are required to be open to male and female membership except in special situations. Special situations include those where there are specific cultural or religious requirements for single sex Explorer Scout Units.</li>
<li>The operation of a Unit must be overseen by a Leader or team of Leaders.<p>A Unit Leadership team comprises of all Section Leaders, Assistant Section Leaders and Section/Unit Assistants working with the Unit. Working with the Unit Leadership team, the Section Leader(s) have responsibility for the planning of the programme and the management of the Unit.</p>
<p>Where there is more than one Section Leader appointed to the Unit, only one of the Section Leaders may opt-in to be an ex officio member of the Group Executive Committee (rule 3.24(b)(iii)).</p>
</li>
<li>The delivery of the Unit programme is the responsibility of the Section Leadership team, led by the Section Leader. Additional adults (for example parents, subject experts from the community) may be used on a regular or occasional basis to support the programme delivery. All additional adults need to conform to the Personal Enquiry and criminal records disclosures checks requirements detailed in <a class="reference external" href="/por/4-the-scout-district/rule-428-the-appointment-of-adults-in-the-scout-district/">Rule 4.28(b)</a>.</li>
<li>The Section Leader(s) have a responsibility to ensure at least two adults (aged 18 or over) are present at each Unit meeting, at least one of whom holds a FULL appointment with the Unit (normally a Section Leader but on occasion may be an Assistant Section Leader or a Section/Unit Assistant).</li>
<li>In the event of no Leader or Section Assistant with a FULL appointment from the Unit Leadership team being able to attend a Unit meeting, it is possible on occasions for another adult member of Scouting, with appropriate youth leadership experience (not necessarily in the same section), to take their place at the meeting or similar event, as long as the District Explorer Scout Commissioner is consulted as soon as practicable in advance and supports the arrangement. Such adults must have satisfactorily completed the Personal Enquiry process and have a FULL appointment.<p>It is expected that this situation will only occur infrequently – if that is not the case the District Explorer Scout Commissioner must take appropriate action to strengthen the Section Leadership team of the Unit.</p>
</li>
<li>Other than two adults being present there is no minimum ratio of adults to Explorers set for regular indoor Unit meetings, but for all meetings and activities Leaders should assess the risk and arrange for sufficient adults (aged 18 or over) to ensure a safe environment for the operation of the Unit, which may vary depending on the programme being delivered.<p>It is good practice to have a mixed leadership team.</p>
</li>
<li>There is no recommended minimum ratio for outdoor activities held away from the usual meeting place or nights away experiences. However, as a minimum, for all Nights Away experiences led by a Nights Away Permit Holder at least two adults must be present overnight. Only in the event of an emergency should an adult be alone overnight with young people on a residential experience.</li>
<li>For all Scouting activities a risk assessment should be carried out as stated in <a class="reference external" href="/por/9-activities/rule-94-risk-assessment/">Rule 9.4</a>. This risk assessment cannot override the minimum requirements stated in Rule 4.7h or those required by the activity rules in <a class="reference external" href="/por/9-activities/">chapter 9</a>.</li>
<li>The age range of the Section is from 14 years to 18 years old. The age for moving from the Scout Section is between 13 1/2 and 14 1/2 years and moving to the Scout Network at 18 years. The leaving age is upon reaching the 18th birthday. Under no circumstances can anyone aged 18 years or over, regardless of ability remain in a youth section (i.e. Squirrel Scouts, Beaver Scouts, Cub Scouts, Scouts or Explorer Scouts).<p>NOTE: A young person who turns 18 during an event or residential activity (of no more than one month’s duration) shall be treated as under 18, and be subject to all rules applicable to under 18 year olds, for the duration of that event.</p>
</li>
<li>The Explorer Scout Unit should have opportunities for the members to take part in the decision making process. Any forum or committee should have both Explorer Scouts and Leaders working together.</li>
<li>Explorer Scouts wear the approved Explorer Scout, Sea Scout or Air Scout uniform with distinguishing emblems and scarves as described in the Chapter 10.</li>
<li>The following minimum standards are laid down for Explorer Scout Units<ul class="simple">
<li>Operation overseen by a leader (<a class="reference external" href="/por/4-the-scout-district/rule-47-explorer-scout-units/">Rule 4.7f</a>).</li>

<li>No individual aged 18 or over may be permitted to undertake any role or responsibilities within Scouting until the appropriate enquiries have been made. The enquiries must include a Personal Enquiry to Headquarters, and certain roles require a criminal records disclosure check as part of the Personal Enquiry process (see the Safeguarding Policy and POR: The Appointment Process).</li>
<li>A Personal Enquiry (including where relevant a criminal records disclosure check) will always be required for any person aged 18 or over who meets any of the following criteria: <sup>sv</sup><ul class="simple">
<li>wishes to become a Member or Associate member (for members of Scout Network - <a class="reference external" href="/por/4-the-scout-district/rule-428-the-appointment-of-adults-in-the-scout-district/">see 4.28m below</a>); or</li>

<li>For the purposes of <a class="reference external" href="/por/4-the-scout-district/rule-428-the-appointment-of-adults-in-the-scout-district/">4.28b</a> above “unsupervised” means not being within sight and hearing of another adult who holds a valid criminal records disclosure check.</li>

Occasional Helpers are not entitled to membership status or member benefits (including certain insurances – see the Unity web site) and the recording on Compass is only provided to enable the Personal Enquiry and criminal records disclosure checks to be conducted. <sup>sv</sup></li>
<li>Certain roles will require a criminal records disclosure check every five years.</li>
<li>A new criminal records disclosure check is not normally required if the individual is simply moving from one role to another within England and Wales; or within Northern Ireland; or within Scotland, provided the procedures have been followed for the initial role, that they have a valid criminal records disclosure check and the person’s service has been continuous. However, depending on the result of previous enquiries a further Personal Enquiry may be required.</li>
<li>Where roles requiring a criminal records disclosure check (<a class="reference external" href="/por/the-appointment-process/">see POR: The Appointment Process</a>) are held in more than one legal jurisdiction (i.e. England and Wales; Scotland; Northern Ireland) separate criminal records disclosure checks must be carried out in all the jurisdictions in which those roles are held.</li>
<li>A Personal Enquiry is initiated by adding the appropriate role to Compass. This should be done as soon as the individual concerned has agreed to take on a role.</li>
<li>When completing a Personal Enquiry accurate information about the individual must be given.</li>
<li>The full rules for the appointment of adults can be found in POR: The Appointment Process.</li>
<li>Occasional Helpers (including parents) who are required to undertake a Personal Enquiry (<a class="reference external" href="/por/4-the-scout-district/rule-428-the-appointment-of-adults-in-the-scout-district/">see 4.28a and 4.28b</a>) must either be entered directly into Compass or recorded using the Association’s official Joining Forms and then be transferred accurately into Compass (available from <a class="reference external" href="http://scouts.org.uk/home/">www.scouts.org.uk/home/</a>). The appropriate on-line or paper based criminal records disclosure check application process must then be followed. <sup>sv</sup></li>
<li>Section leaders should ensure that Occasional Helpers who are involved more than once a month are aware of the appointment opportunities available to them.</li>
<li>Members of Scout Network are required to undertake a Personal Enquiry without a criminal records disclosure check (by being added to Compass as a member of the relevant District Scout Network). If members of Scout Network assist with or supervise members of a younger Section, they must be appointed to an appropriate role (such as an Occasional Helper, Section Assistant or Leader) and undertake the relevant appointment process (including undertaking a criminal records disclosure check).</li>

<li>accruals (SOFA) accounts for a multi fund unit. guidance and templates available from <a class="reference external" href="http://www.charitysorp.org">www.charitysorp.org</a><p>The appropriate model will depend upon the annual gross income in the financial year and whether the District has any special funds whose use is restricted to particular purposes rather than the general purposes of the District.</p>

</li>
<li>At each Annual General Meeting of the District Scout Council a scrutineer, independent examiner or auditor as appropriate must be appointed.</li>
<li>Each District can decide if they need an auditor, independent examiner or scrutineer, by reference to the factsheet Accounting and Audit Requirements for Group, Districts, Counties/Areas and Scottish Regions.</li>
