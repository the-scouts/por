<li>are appropriate persons to volunteer with The Scout Association;</li>
<li>are appropriate for the roles they are undertaking; and</li>
<li>fully accept the responsibilities of the roles and, where appropriate, the responsibilities of membership of The Scout Association.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Principles:</strong> The appointment process must be run so that:<ol class="lowerroman simple">
<li>the applicant feels welcomed and not threatened by the appointment process;</li>
<li>the applicant is kept informed of progress through the appointment process;</li>
<li>the Association has robust assurance of appointing only appropriate people; and</li>
<li>the applicant takes a role that is appropriate to their skills, knowledge and attitude.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Stages of appointment:</strong> All adult appointments pass through four stages in the appointment process:<p>&lt;table border=‘“1”’ cellpadding=‘“5”’ width=‘“100%”’&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;</p>

<ol class="loweralpha">
<li>An Appointments Advisory Committee is mandatory for each District and each County/Area/ Region (Scotland) and primarily exists to assist with the process of appointing adults in Scouting.</li>

<li><strong>Appointments Chair</strong>: The Appointments Chair is appointed to lead the Appointments Advisory Committee.

<li><strong>Appointments Members</strong>: Sufficient members must be appointed to ensure that three members can be found to undertake the meeting with each applicant.</li>

</li>
<li>In appointing the members of the Appointments Advisory Committee, the Executive Committee should bear in mind the range of skills and attributes that will be required in committee members.

<ol class="loweralpha simple">
<li>The Appointments Chair, Appointments Secretary and other members of the Appointments Advisory Committee must show that they are competent to carry out this important role of checking potential new adult volunteers in The Scout Association. It is therefore mandatory that members meet certain validation criteria that are defined in The Scout Association’s adult training scheme and complete Module 1 Essential Information, Safety, Safeguarding, GDPR and Module 37 Advising on Adult Appointments. Note that for an Appointment Panel it is good practice that the Panel members are fully validated against their training obligations.</li>
<li>As the line manager, the Appointments Chair is responsible for ensuring that all members of the Appointments Advisory Committee have completed the required modules. The Appointments Chair, however, does not necessarily have to be the Training Adviser for the Appointments Advisory Committee members. The Appointments Chair should work closely with the County/Area Training Manager/Assistant Regional Commissioner Adult Training (Scotland) or the Local Training Manager (according to local arrangements) to co-ordinate the allocation of appropriately skilled Training Advisers to ensure the validation of each role holder.</li>

<ol class="loweralpha simple">
<li>The Appointments Advisory Committee is responsible for the following areas:<ol class="lowerroman simple">
<li>Appointment Panels: meeting with new adults or existing adults who have changed role to assess whether they are aware of and willing to uphold the current values and policies of The Scout Association and whether they understand the requirements of the role and are able to carry them out.</li>
<li>Appointment Reviews: supporting the review process, considering (with the line manager) the outcome of a review.</li>
<li>Suspensions: on request following the local suspension of an adult, recommending continuation of suspension, re-instatement, modification or cancellation of an appointment.</li>
<li>Complaints: on request, taking part in the resolution of complaints from applicants regarding the outcome of the appointment process; and</li>
<li>Cancellations: on request, considering together with the Commissioner recommendations to end appointments and/or a person’s involvement in Scouting as a result of disagreements between adults.</li>
</ol>

<section id="the-appointment-panel-meeting">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#the-appointment-panel-meeting">The Appointment Panel Meeting</a></h2>
<ol class="loweralpha">
<li>The local Appointments Advisory Committee may agree that there are some roles or circumstances when candidates will not be required to meet with an Appointment Panel. It is expected that an Appointment Panel will normally meet with persons new to Scouting in the County or District. But Appointments Advisory Committees may, for example, choose to not normally have an Appointment Panel meet with a person changing from Section Leader to Assistant Section Leader in the same Section, or an Explorer Scout Young Leader taking on a Section Assistant role when they reach the age of 18.<p>Similarly, if an Appointment Advisory Panel has recently met the applicant for another appointment, the committee may decide not to meet the applicant again.</p>
<p>It is good governance practice for the whole Appointments Advisory Committee to discuss their implementation of local Panel arrangements, to agree their proposals with their parent Executive Committee, and to reconfirm (with updates if required) with their parent Executive Committee on an annual basis.</p>
</li>
<li>The decision to meet with candidates (or not) is entirely one for the Appointments Advisory Committee to make.</li>
<li>To balance the need for a suitably rigorous selection process and the need for a welcoming and non-threatening process, exactly three members of the Appointments Advisory Committee (the Appointment Panel) will be required to determine an applicant’s appropriateness for an appointment by meeting with the applicant. It is good practice for a member of the Panel to be aged under 25, and for the Panel to have an ‘equal opportunities’ mix of membership, including a current practitioner in a ‘programme’ role. Except in cases specifically agreed in advance with the Appointments Chair, a Panel meets with only one applicant at one time</li>
<li>In some circumstances, the Appointments Chair may allow one additional person to be present at the meeting, for example if Module 37 is being validated, or if the applicant needs an interpreter/signer to attend the meeting.</li>
<li>The line manager of the applicant is not allowed to be a member of the Appointment Panel that meets the applicant, nor can the applicant’s line manager be present at any such meeting (so if an interpreter/signer is required for (e) above then that role may not be undertaken by the applicant’s line manager).</li>
<li>The Appointment Panel members will assess the following areas:<ol class="lowerroman simple">
<li><strong>Values and policies:</strong> that the applicant is aware of and accepts (and by personal example is prepared to uphold and promote) the values and policies of The Scout Association – including confirming the applicant’s willingness to make and live by the Scout Promise if applying for a Member role (as defined in Table 2: Appointments).</li>
<li><strong>Role:</strong> that the applicant understands the requirements of the role and is able and willing to carry it out.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The purpose of the Appointment Panel is restricted to these two topics.</p>
<p>The Panel meeting role does not include consideration of the outcomes of Personal Enquiry or references.</p>

<section id="reviewing-appointments">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#reviewing-appointments">Reviewing Appointments</a></h2>
<ol class="loweralpha simple">
<li>It is good practice for line manager and role holder to hold an informal review meeting at least annually – an opportunity to mutually take stock to celebrate successes and to plan for the future. It is also an opportunity to determine if the role holder has any additional training needs (including the required on-going training) and also to agree whether another role would be more suitable.</li>
<li>A ‘formal’ Appointment Review normally takes place during the final 6 months of an appointment (though can be convened by either the line manager or the role holder at any time). A key outcome of this meeting will include an agreement over whether the individual’s appointment should be renewed, whether they should take on a different role, or whether they will leave Scouting. It is good practice for line manager and role holder to agree the approximate first review date at the start of a role and record that on Compass.</li>
<li>The purpose of the review is therefore to determine whether:<ol class="lowerroman simple">
<li>the appointment is to continue for another period; or</li>
<li>the appointment is to be ended; or</li>
<li>the adult will apply for a different role.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Although the determination should be agreed between the appointee and their line manager, ultimately the line manager makes the decision whether to Reappoint, Reassign or Retire the appointee.</p>
<p>d.Unless indicated differently in Table 2: Appointments, the appointee’s line manager is responsible for ensuring that the formal Review is conducted during the final 6 months of an appointment (or earlier if required by the relevant Commissioner).</p>
<p>On-going training requirements must be monitored at the point of each ‘formal’ Appointment Review.</p>
<ol class="loweralpha simple" start="5">
<li>The line manager has a responsibility to ensure timely Appointment Reviews are held (see (b) above). The Appointments Secretary should support the Appointment Review process and should maintain an oversight of the Appointment Review process in the County/District. Roles requiring Appointment Review are listed in Table 2: Appointments.</li>
</ol>
<p>Line managers (unless otherwise stated in Table 2: Appointments) should schedule an Appointment Review to be held no later than the ‘next review date’ recorded on Compass [if no such date is recorded than it must take place no later than 5 years after the role start date or 5 years after the previous Appointment Review].</p>
<ol class="loweralpha simple" start="6">
<li>It is good practice to schedule the meeting 3 months in advance. However, where an earlier Appointment Review is requested (by line manager or appointment holder or the relevant Commissioner) then a shorter notice period is acceptable, though there must be at least two weeks’ notice except in the most exceptional circumstances. During an Appointment Review the person carrying out the review will record the details on Form AR (including the recommended outcome of the review) and pass the completed form to the Appointments Secretary.</li>
<li>The Appointments Advisory Committee (note 3.5 above) and the relevant District, County, Area or Regional (Scotland) Commissioner together consider the completed Form AR and reach a decision on the review of the appointment. The purpose of this meeting is to ensure that an appropriate Appointment Review process has been followed, and that the recommended outcomes are being actioned.</li>
<li>The Appointments Secretary is informed and records the decision. The Appointment Secretary must also update Compass appropriately (if not already updated by the line manager), including recording the date for the next Appointment Review (if required).</li>

<p>Ending or non-renewal of an appointment should be used where necessary, however the appropriate Commissioner may apply restrictions or suspension to ensure a volunteer rectifies issues.

<p>Although it is good practice to have discussions relating to ending appointments or cancelling membership in the framework of an Appointment Review, action may be taken without an Appointment Review where the responsible Commissioner and the responsible Commissioner’s line manager agree that circumstances require it. In these cases the role holder must be advised of the reasons for the cancellation or non-renewal.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding any other means provided by these Rules, the Membership of any Member or Associate Member of the Movement may be cancelled by resolution of the Board of Trustees of the Scout Association.

<li>In exceptional circumstances Headquarters may, after consultation with the relevant Commissioner, end or refuse to renew an appointment.

<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#adult-volunteer-roles">Adult Volunteer Roles</a></h2>
<ol class="loweralpha simple">
<li>Scouting’s activities are delivered or supported by adults in various roles. These roles are listed in Table 2 below. Only roles listed in Table 2 may be allocated on Compass - Table 2 reflects all appointable roles that are available. All roles in Table 2 have Member/Associate Member status.</li>
<li>Several of the roles are governance roles. It is important in law that key governance roles – Chair, Secretary and Treasurer – are always filled. If a Chair, Secretary or Treasurer resigns during the period between AGMs, then the Executive Committee should appoint a member of the Executive Committee to the role, subject to approval by a majority of the members of the relevant Executive and (for the role of Chair) the appointing Commissioner (GSL, DC or CC as appropriate).<ol class="lowerroman simple">
<li>If none of the Executive Committee members are able to take on the vacant Chair, Secretary or Treasurer role, then an appropriate person can be co-opted as an Executive Committee member, subject to the relevant rules elsewhere in POR (Rules 3.24 (b) (iii), 4.25 (f) (iii), 5.15 (f) (iii)), and the approval by a majority of the members of the relevant Executive and (for the role of Chair) the appointing Commissioner (GSL, DC or CC as appropriate).</li>
<li>Such appointments to the Chair, Secretary or Treasurer roles are valid only for the short-term, until the next Annual General Meeting. Note that there is no role of Acting Chair, Acting Secretary or Acting Treasurer available – the process above must be followed to fill a short-term role until the next Annual General Meeting.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>There are a set of people who provide informal support. These people are often referred to as Helpers. As stated in Rule 1.2 ‘Helpers’; Additional adults (for example parents or subject experts from the community) may be used to support the delivery of programme. The Personal Enquiry and criminal records disclosures checks requirements detailed in Rule 3.27(b), 4.28(b) and 5.19(f) must apply wherever applicable for these adults. A person who requires a Personal Enquiry (including where relevant a criminal records disclosure check) [Rules 3.27, 4.28, 5.19] and who does not have an active role on Compass that includes a criminal records disclosure check must be registered on Compass as an Occasional HelperSV. This Occasional Helper role on Compass is not otherwise part of the Appointment Process, carries no membership status and is only provided to enable the Personal Enquiry and criminal records disclosure checks to be conducted if required by Rules 3.27, 4.28 and 5.19. It is therefore not included in the Table 2 below. To obtain a criminal records disclosure the person must be recorded on Compass (as Occasional Helpers, or – in Scotland – as PVG-only, but this is not a ‘role’ and is simply a route to obtaining the necessary criminal records check disclosure.</li>
<li>Also included in Compass should be nominated, elected or co-opted Council members. This role is also not included in Table 2 because it is not a ‘member’ role but is rather a role that Members or Associate Members may acquire.</li>
<li>Certain staff members also require access to Compass and these roles are also recorded on Compass. Again, these roles are not recorded in Table 2.</li>
