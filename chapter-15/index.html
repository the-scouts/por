<ol class="loweralpha">
<li>The following also applies to Members of the Scout Network.</li>
<li>Suspension of any involvement in Scouting by a Member, Associate Member or a non-Member is an act intended to protect all persons involved. It assists to ensure that any investigation or inquiry proceeds in as fair and objective manner as possible by preventing situations arising which could give rise to further concerns/allegations or which could potentially cause further compromise.<p>Suspension is permitted in the following circumstances:</p>
<ol class="lowerroman">
<li>when an allegation is made that an individual involved in Scouting has committed a serious criminal offence. In this case the individual must be suspended until police inquiries and/or any legal proceedings have been concluded;</li>
<li>when a disagreement or dispute between adults remains unresolved for a period of more than 30 days (commencing from when a formal written notification of the dispute is provided to the relevant Executive Committee), suspension in this case is to be for a period of not more than 90 days in the first instance. Suspension for further periods of not more than 90 days may follow and must be communicated to the suspended individual;</li>
<li>if a Member or Associate Member makes a formal, public challenge (to a non-Scouting organisation, body or forum) against the decision or policy of either:<ul>
<li>a local Executive Committee of a Scout unit (of which that Member or Associate Member is a member)<p>and/or</p>
</li>
<li>The Scout Association<p>where such public challenge seeks to change, overturn or reverse the said decision or policy or causes adverse publicity about the same.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>where the intentional action or inaction of an individual involved in Scouting could seriously harm the reputation of the Movement.</li>
<li>when the action of an individual involved in Scouting may constitute gross misconduct</li>
<li>where an individual involved in Scouting requiring a Criminal Record Disclosure Check for their role in Scouting does not hold such a disclosure and a period of 30 days (where an electronic system is used) or 60 days (where a paper based system is used) has expired since one was held or required.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>In every case Membership may be suspended only by the appropriate authority with approval from the other appropriate authority as defined in the following table:</li>

<p>Note: Where issues of Safeguarding are involved see also Rule 2.4q</p>
<ol class="loweralpha">
<li>During a suspension under this Rule, any Appointment Certificate and Appointment Card must be surrendered to the suspending authority on request.</li>
<li>The suspended person must not:<ul>
<li>Participate in any activity connected with the Movement (whether or not young people are present) including administrative activities;</li>
<li>Contact youth Members of the Association;</li>
<li>enter Association premises unless specifically given permission by the appropriate Commissioner;</li>
<li>be present at any place at which Scouting activities are taking place (including all types of activity whether or not young people are present);</li>
<li>wear the uniform or badges of the Association.<p>The suspending authority is permitted to modify the list of prohibited activities above when the suspended person is a parent or carer of a youth member in Scouting, and must follow the following criteria:</p>
<ol class="lowerroman simple">
<li>In safeguarding cases the guidance of the Safeguarding Team must be sought and followed.</li>
<li>all modifications must be agreed with the authority that approved the suspension as defined in Rule 15.2c.</li>
<li>the modifications must be kept to a minimum and are only to enable the suspended person as parent or carer to participate to some extent in Scouting with their child (for example, to attend award presentations or to drop off and pick-up the child).</li>
<li>The modifications must not compromise the safety and wellbeing of youth members.</li>
<li>Where Rule 15.2b (vi) applies, the modifications must not allow the suspended individual to engage in regulated activity.</li>
<li>The suspending authority must inform the suspended person in writing with very clear instructions regarding what is permitted.</li>
<li>The suspending authority may change or remove the modifications during the period of suspension and must notify the suspended person in writing.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>They must be informed of their suspension in writing and given a copy of the information sheet Notes for a person under suspension. (Available from the Scout Information Centre, the Safeguarding Team or Country HQ)</li>
<li>They must also be offered an independent Scouting colleague to act as a liaison point. The information sheet Supporting a person under suspension provides relevant guidelines. (Available from the Scout Information Centre, the Safeguarding Team or Country HQ)</li>
<li>Any appointment held will be regarded as vacant.</li>
<li>Suspension in the case of disagreement must be followed as soon as possible by conciliation and such further steps as are necessary.</li>
<li>When a person is suspended or the nature of the suspension changes, the appropriate Commissioner must inform the Vetting Team at Headquarters and a Form CS must be completed.</li>
<li>The procedures for suspension detailed in this Rule must not be applied to Squirrel Scouts, Beaver Scouts, Cub Scouts, Scouts, or Explorer Scouts.</li>
<li>At the end of a period of suspension the appropriate Commissioner and the appropriate Appointments Advisory Committee (where appropriate consulting the Group Scout Leader and the Sponsoring Authority) must agree a recommendation for action and seek approval for that action from the authority who originally approved the suspension. See table above.i. If the Appointments Advisory Committee and the appropriate Commissioner disagree on the recommendation for action then the final decision lies with the authority who originally approved the suspension.</li>

<li>If the authority who originally approved the suspension disagrees with the recommendation for action following discussion with the Appointments Advisory Committee and the appropriate Commissioner), then the final decision lines with the authority who originally approved the suspension.</li>

<ol class="loweralpha simple" start="13">
<li>The action must include a recommendation to re-instate, modify or revoke the appointment of the adult under suspension. There is no right of appeal against a decision made by an Appointment Advisory Committee or a decision made by the authority who approved the suspension.</li>
<li>When reviewing a suspension and making the subsequent recommendation those responsible must follow a similar process as used when appointing adults and give the same considerations as to the suitability of the individual to carry out a specific role, i.e. they must satisfy themselves that the subject continues to be an appropriate person for a particular appointment.</li>
<li>The suspended person must be informed in writing of the decision which ends a period of suspension and in each case a record of the discussions and outcomes must be documented and forwarded to the Vetting Team at Headquarters.</li>
<li>In exceptional circumstances Headquarters may, in consultation with the responsible District or County Commissioner, refuse to re-instate membership, an appointment and/or any involvement in Scouting.</li>
<li>Headquarters may directly end a period of suspension by excluding a suspended person from Scouting if the individual is unsuitable to participate in Scouting.</li>
<li>In the case of individuals suspended under Rule 15.2b (vi), suspension may be automatically revoked by headquarters once a valid Criminal Records Check Disclosure has been satisfactorily obtained.</li>

<ol class="loweralpha simple">
<li>Formal suspension of a youth member may be appropriate where they have been accused of a serious criminal offence or of behaviour that put adults or young people at serious risk of harm. See also the factsheet Guidance on the formal suspension of youth members.</li>
<li>Suspension is not a disciplinary sanction or an indication of guilt but ensures that no situation can arise that may cause further concern and allows a period where further information may be received and if appropriate the statutory agencies (typically the police or social services) may carry out their duties.</li>
<li>The District Commissioner has the authority to suspend a young person. However wherever possible they should act in consultation with the relevant Group Scout Leader / Explorer Scout Leader.</li>
<li>Before suspending a young person, District Commissioners should consult their County Commissioner and must inform the Country HQ.</li>
<li>Where a statutory authority is involved, advice must be sought from that body.</li>
<li>Where a young person’s membership has been suspended they may not participate in any activity connected with Scouting and must not wear the uniform or badges.</li>
<li>The parents / carers of the youth member must be informed of their suspension in writing and given a copy of the information sheet Notes for the parents /carers for the young person.</li>
