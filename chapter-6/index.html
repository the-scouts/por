Its powers and constitution are stated in its Memorandum and Articles of Association. It was created to ease the administrative burden faced by Scout Units in
having to find/appoint/retain local individual Holding Trustees to hold title to their land and to also ensure consistency by holding important land documentation securely in a central location. Where appointed, the SATC can hold title to freehold, leasehold and long-term Licence land interests as a
sole Custodian Trustee on behalf of Scout Units registered with The Scout Association in the United Kingdom (excepting Scotland and Northern Ireland). It can also hold title to land held by jointly by Scout and Guide Units. As Custodian Trustee, whilst the SATC will be a party and signatory to any substantive land documentation, it cannot and does not have any responsibility for the management of a Scout Unit or its land.
