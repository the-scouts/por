<ul class="simple">
<li>archery;</li>
<li>caving;</li>
<li>climbing and abseiling, except;<ul>

For joint activities with under and over 18 members the activity permit scheme applies. Where these activities are being run by non-members, see Rule 9.9 Use of External Centres and Instructors.<p>Note: This rule also applies to staff and employees operating on behalf of The Scout Association (or any Group, District, County or Country thereof).</p>
</li>
<li>A Commissioner issues a permit on the recommendation of an assessor and in accordance with the process and content of the factsheet <a class="reference external" href="https://www.scouts.org.uk/volunteers/running-your-section/programme-guidance/activity-permit-scheme/commissioners-guide/">FS120103 Adventurous Activity Permit Scheme – Commissioners’ Guide.</a></li>

<li>There is no minimum or maximum age to hold a leadership or supervisory permit (except any imposed by outside agencies). There is no minimum age to hold a personal permit, but the maximum age is 17.</li>
<li>Recommendations for permits may be made by County assessors or external assessors in accordance with the <em>`FS120104 Adventurous Activity Permit Scheme – Approved Assessors. &lt;https://www.scouts.org.uk/volunteers/running-your-section/programme-guidance/activity-permit-scheme/approved-assessors/&gt;`__</em></li>
<li>Permits must have an expiry date of not more than five years. When a permit expires the permit holder must apply for, be assessed for and be granted a new permit before they are able to run the activity again.</li>
<li>Where a leadership or supervisory permit holder is under 18 their permit will expire on their 18th birthday if the required safeguarding checks for an adult holding a permit have not been carried out. When they turn 18 they can be granted a new permit, once the required safeguarding checks have been carried out, without the need for another assessment, to expire no longer than five years after their initial permit was granted.</li>
<li>All groups undertaking adventurous activities must have immediate access to someone holding a relevant and current first aid qualification. This need not be the permit holder. The detail of the first aid skills required will be identified by the risk assessment, but the minimum qualifications (or equivalents) are:<ul class="simple">

<li>Where a permit holder is not following the activity rules or running the activity in an unsafe manner, their Commissioner may review and further restrict or cancel their permit.</li>
<li>Each County is required to carry out a self- moderation of their management of the adventurous activity permit scheme by the end of each January in accordance with the details in <em>`FS120106 Adventurous Activity Permit Scheme – Moderation. &lt;https://www.scouts.org.uk/volunteers/running-your-section/programme-guidance/activity-permit-scheme/moderation/&gt;`__</em></li>

<p>Delivery of activities using an external provider can enrich the programme, but a number of factors require consideration. This rule intends to provide a structure to support leaders in making informed decisions about the suitability of external providers.</p>
<ol class="loweralpha">
<li>When external providers are used for the delivery of activities for members of The Scout Association the external provider must hold a relevant accreditation or qualification for the activity they are delivering (e.g. AALA Licence, Adventure Mark Accredited Provider, Government Agency, National Governing Body qualifications) as well as adequate insurance cover. These criteria are subject to frequent change and up to date guidance on the above can be found in the A-Z directory at <a class="reference external" href="https://www.scouts.org.uk/activities/?orderBy=title%20asc&amp;category=Adventure">scouts.org.uk/a-z.</a><p>As the standards and criteria for the delivery of activities overseas are very varied it is not possible to provide specific guidance for each country and activity. Leaders therefore need to check the suitability of providers themselves and this rule supports that process with additional guidance.</p>
</li>
<li>When using external providers overseas, <a class="reference external" href="https://www.scouts.org.uk/volunteers/running-your-section/international-scouts-and-events/international-activities/adventurous-activities-abroad/">the guidance for activities overseas must be followed</a>. If the leader in charge feels that the activity is not safe then the activity should be stopped immediately.</li>
<li>External activity providers must provide evidence of holding a public liability insurance policy which covers their activities to a minimum level of 5 million pounds.</li>
<li>Members when using external activity providers are required to follow all rules relevant to the activity as contained within Chapter 9, with the exception of any which explicitly relate to the delivery of Scout-led activity.</li>

There is no longer the need to buy the additional cover (this refers to those who are running or owning climbing activities at a Group level only). Cover is still required to be purchased for Scout campsites and activity centres, District and County owned climbing and abseiling walls. This includes mobile climbing walls used at any Scout premises and/or public events. If you are uncertain of the requirements for additional insurance for climbing and abseiling activities please contact Unity (Scout Insurance Services) for more information.</p>
</li>
<li>Other than (g) above, the only persons who may undertake abseiling and climbing activities using Scout equipment and/or under Scout supervision are Members of the Scout and Guide Movements.</li>

<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#rule-9-64-visits-abroad">Rule 9.64 Visits Abroad</a></h2>
<p>A Visit Abroad is defined as: ‘Any visit outside the United Kingdom, the Channel islands and the Isle of Man on a recognised and approved Scouting activity or travelling in the name of Scouting. This applies to youth and adult Members, Associate Members and non-Members’.</p>
<p>‘Youth and adult members, Associate Members and non-Members located within the British Scouting Overseas area and Northern Ireland are expected to follow the Visits Abroad Process when leaving the country where their group is registered. However, exceptionally, specific alternative arrangements may be approved and documented by a relevant Commissioner’.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: For NI Scouts travelling to the Republic of Ireland it is no longer a requirement to take out additional travel insurance, providing the trip is for no longer than 48 hours. If you feel that you require cover for emergency medical expenses, personal possession or cancellation then it is strongly advised that you should buy travel insurance. All members should carry a valid EHIC card for travelling within many European Countries including the Republic of Ireland. EHIC cards are obtainable from the NHS website.</p>
<ol class="loweralpha">
<li>A camp or residential experience abroad which includes Beaver Scouts, Cub Scouts, Scouts, or Explorer Scouts, must be led by an adult holding a relevant Nights Away Permit. For Scout Network visits abroad see Rule 9.61h.</li>
<li>All visits abroad must follow the VA Process and be approved at planning stage by the relevant Commissioner to the designation of the trip:<ul>
<li>England and Northern Ireland: District or County Commissioner and Assistant County Commissioner for International.</li>
<li>Scotland: District or Regional Commissioner and Regional International Adviser.</li>
<li>Wales: District or Area Commissioner and Assistant Area Commissioner for International.</li>
<li>BSO: District Commissioner and Assistant Area Commissioner for International.</li>
<li>Countries/UK/HQ: UK International Commissioner, Scottish HQ Commissioner (International), Deputy Commissioner Wales – Programme (International).<p>The trip must then gain final approval and sign off by the relevant Commissioner before the visit leaves the UK. A VA Form must be submitted to the Assistant County Commissioner (International) or International Adviser who supports such events on behalf of United Kingdom headquarters. As part of this process, the Assistant County Commissioner for International (or equivalent) must complete the online VA notification form, notifying UK Headquarters of the trip.</p>
<p><em>The VA Form and guidance on the process can be found on `www.scouts.org.uk/international &lt;https://www.scouts.org.uk/volunteers/running-your-section/international-scouts-and-events/going-abroad-with-scouting/&gt;`__or through notifying your Assistant County Commissioner (International) or County International Adviser (or equivalent) of your planned visit.</em></p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The UK Leader in Charge of a visit abroad must ensure that adequate travel insurance has been arranged for all members of the party, and that suitable InTouch arrangements are in place (<a class="reference external" href="https://www.scouts.org.uk/por/9-activities/#9.3">Rule 9.3</a>)</li>
<li>The UK Leader in Charge of any adventurous activities abroad must apply the appropriate rules and hold the appropriate adventurous activity permits, classifying the hills/mountains or waters as defined in Rules <a class="reference external" href="https://www.scouts.org.uk/por/9-activities/#9.28">9.28</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://www.scouts.org.uk/por/9-activities/#9.29">9.29</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://www.scouts.org.uk/por/9-activities/#9.30">9.30</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://www.scouts.org.uk/por/9-activities/#9.44">9.44</a>, although the altitude criteria for hills/mountains may not apply in some areas. In case of doubt, the Assistant County Commissioner (Activities) or Adviser should be consulted.</li>
<li>When overseas, UK members may take part in activities being run by members of the host Scout organisation following the host organisation’s guidance and rules. In this context, Kandersteg International Scout Centre is deemed an independent Scout organisation. There must be a Leader from the UK present who is able to halt the activity if they have safety concerns at any point. Activities forbidden by UK Scouting remain forbidden even when overseas. If using external providers overseas please see POR <a class="reference external" href="https://www.scouts.org.uk/por/9-activities/#9.9">Rule 9.9b</a> for further guidance.</li>
