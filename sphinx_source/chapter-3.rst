:Title: THE SCOUT GROUP

Scouting in the United Kingdom is organised in Scout Groups, Scout Districts, Scout Counties and Country Headquarters. These 'units' of Scouting provide:

* support;
* channels for communication;
* opportunities for youth Members and adults to make decisions and take responsibility;
* functional units through which the design and delivery of the youth programme can be best achieved.

A Scout Group comprises one or more of any or all of the following: a Squirrel Scout Drey, a Beaver Scout Colony; a Cub Scout Pack or a Scout Troop. Additionally, a Group may also include one or more Group Scout Active Support Units. An Explorer Scout Unit may also be attached to a Scout Group (see :rule:`3!Partnerships with Explorer Scout Units`).



.. rule:: Membership of the Scout Group

a. No individual aged 18 or over may be permitted to undertake any role or responsibilities within Scouting until the appropriate enquiries have been made. The enquiries must include a Personal Enquiry to Headquarters, and certain roles require a disclosure as part of the Personal Enquiry process (see the Safeguarding Policy and :chapter:`POR-TAP`).

b. There are two types of membership -- Members and Associate Members.

c. British Subjects who are prepared to follow the Association's principles by making the Promise may become Members or Associate Members of the Scout Movement (subject to the Rules contained within Policy, Organisation and Rules).

.. rule:: Admission to membership

a. The decision to admit anyone to membership of a Scout Group rests with the Group Scout Leader, in accordance with The Scout Association's policies. In the case of a Sponsored Scout Group, this decision should also be subject to the recruitment policy (if any) defined in any sponsorship agreement.

   Guidance on Sponsored Groups can be found on our `website <https://www.scouts.org.uk/volunteers/running-your-section/administration/community-sponsorship/>`__

b. The Group Scout Leader will generally delegate responsibility for admissions to the Leader in charge of the Section concerned. This decision must be made in accordance with The Scout Association's Policies.

c. There may be situations where a Group does not have the capacity or resources to meet the needs of a young person or make the reasonable adjustments necessary. In such instances, the District Commissioner should work with the parents/carer to find an alternative Group.



.. rule:: Forfeit of membership

a. Squirrel Scouts, Beaver Scouts, Cub Scouts and Scouts forfeit membership if they leave the Group and do not immediately join another Section.

b. Membership is held continuously during the transfer from one Section to the next including the transfer from Scouts to Explorer Scouts and Explorer Scouts to Network.

g. Special situations are defined as being where:

   * there are cultural or religious requirements for single sex working;
   * Scouting is offered in a single sex institution (e.g. school, young offenders institute) through a closed Scout Group);
   * a specialist single sex provision is required to meet a clearly identified educational need (e.g. Scouting for young mothers).

   The decision whether Groups may become an exception to the policy is made by the District Commissioner in consultation with the County Commissioner.



.. rule:: The Squirrel Scout Drey

**Size of Drey**

a. The recommended maximum size for a Drey is 24 Squirrel Scouts.

b. This number may be exceeded with the agreement of the Group Scout Leader.

   When deciding on the Drey size, Leaders should take into account the leadership available, the needs of the young people and the capacity of the meeting venue and whether it might be more effective to run more than one Drey.

**Leadership**

c. The operation of the Drey must be overseen by a Leader or team of Leaders.

   A Drey Leadership team comprises all Section Leaders, Assistant Section Leaders, Section Assistants, and Explorer Scout Young Leaders working with the Drey. Working with the Drey Leadership team, the Section Leader(s) have responsibility for the planning of the programme and the management of the Drey.

   Where there is more than one Section Leader appointed to the Drey, only one of the Section Leaders may opt-in to be an ex officio member of the Group Executive Committee (:rule:`3!The Constitution of the Scout Group!(b)(iii)`).

d. The delivery of the Drey programme is the responsibility of the Drey Leadership team, led by the Section Leader(s). Additional adults (for example parents, subject experts from the community) may be used on a regular or occasional basis to support the programme delivery. All additional adults need to conform to the Personal Enquiry and criminal records disclosures checks requirements detailed in :rule:`3!The Appointment of Adults!(b)`.

   Explorer Scout Young Leaders are part of the Drey Leadership team but remain the responsibility of the Section Leader and must adhere to :rule:`4!The Appointment of Explorer Scout Young Leaders`.

e. The Section Leader(s) have a responsibility to ensure that at least three adults (aged 18 or over) are present at each Drey meeting, at least one of whom holds a FULL appointment with the Section (normally a Section leader but on occasion may be an Assistant Section Leader or a Section Assistant).

f. In the event of no Leader, Assistant Leader or Section Assistant with a FULL appointment from the Drey Leadership Team being able to attend a Drey meeting, it is possible for another adult member of Scouting, with appropriate youth leadership experience (not necessarily in the same section), to take their place at the meeting or similar event, as long as the Group Scout Leader is consulted as soon as practicable in advance and supports the arrangement. Such adults must have satisfactorily completed the Personal Enquiry process and have a FULL appointment.

   It is expected that this situation will only occur infrequently -- if that is not the case the Group Scout Leader must take appropriate action to strengthen the Section Leadership team of the Drey.

g. The recommended minimum ratio for regular indoor Drey meetings is 1 adult to 6 Squirrel Scouts plus the leader in charge. For all meetings and activities Leaders should assess the risk and arrange for sufficient adults (aged 18 or over) to ensure a safe environment for the operation of the Drey, which may vary depending on the programme.

   It is good practise to have a mixed leadership team.

h. The recommended minimum ratio for outdoor activities held away from the usual meeting place is 1 adult to 4 Squirrel Scouts plus the leader in charge.

   Nights away residential experiences are not permitted for the Squirrel Scout section.

i. For all Scouting activities a risk assessment should be carried out as stated in :rule:`9!Risk Assessment`. This risk assessment cannot override the minimum requirements stated in :rule:`3!The Squirrel Scout Drey!(e)` and :rule:`3!The Squirrel Scout Drey!(h)` or those required by the activity rules in :chapter:`9`.

**Age Range, Uniform and Programme**

j. The core age range of the Squirrel Scout Drey is from 4 years to 6 years.

k. Squirrel Scouts wear the approved uniform with distinguishing badges and scarves as described in :chapter:`10`.

l. All Squirrel Scouts should be offered a high quality balanced Programme, run in accordance with the Association's official publications for the Section.

   - The delivery of a high quality balanced Programme (:rule:`3!The Squirrel Scout Drey!(k)`)
   - Opportunities for the members to take part in the decision making process.

n. The District Commissioner, with the District Team, is required where necessary to assist Dreys to reach the minimum standards detailed above.

o. If a Drey fails to reach the minimum standard for 2 consecutive years, the District Commissioner, with the approval of the District Executive Committee, may close it. If it fails to reach the minimum standard for 3 consecutive years, it must be closed.



.. rule:: The Beaver Scout Colony

**Size of Colony**

a. The recommended maximum size for a Colony is 24 Beaver Scouts.

g. Other than two adults being present there is no minimum ratio of adults to Beaver Scouts set for regular indoor Colony meetings, but for all meetings and activities Leaders should assess the risk and arrange for sufficient adults (aged 18 or over) to ensure a safe environment for the operation of the Colony, which may vary depending on the programme.

b. A Personal Enquiry (including where relevant a criminal records disclosure check) will always be required for any person aged 18 or over who meets any of the following criteria:\ :sv:`#`

   * wishes to become a Member or Associate member (for members of Scout Network -- see :rule:`3!The Appointment of Adults!(m)` below); or
   * will be a member of an Executive Committee; or

A person who requires a Personal Enquiry under :rule:`3!The Appointment of Adults!(b)` above (including where relevant a criminal records disclosure check) and who does not have an active role on Compass must be registered on Compass as an Occasional Helper. Occasional Helpers are not entitled to membership status or member benefits (including certain insurances -- see the Unity web site) and the recording on Compass is only provided to enable the Personal Enquiry and criminal records disclosure checks to be conducted.\ :sv:`#`

e. Certain roles will require a criminal records disclosure check every five years.

f. A new criminal records disclosure check is not normally required if the individual is simply moving from one role to another within England and Wales; or within Northern Ireland; or within Scotland, provided the procedures have been followed for the initial role, that they have a valid criminal records disclosure check and the person's service has been continuous. However, depending on the result of previous enquiries a further Personal Enquiry may be required.

g. Where roles requiring a criminal records disclosure check (see :chapter:`POR-TAP`) are held in more than one legal jurisdiction (i.e. England and Wales; Scotland; Northern Ireland) separate criminal records disclosure checks must be carried out in all the jurisdictions in which those roles are held.

h. A Personal Enquiry is initiated by adding the appropriate role to Compass. This should be done as soon as the individual concerned has agreed to take on a role.

i. When completing a Personal Enquiry accurate information about the individual must be given.

j. The full rules for the appointment of adults can be found in :chapter:`POR-TAP`.

k. Occasional Helpers (including parents) who are required to undertake a Personal enquiry (see :rule:`3!The Appointment of Adults!(a)` and :rule:`3!The Appointment of Adults!(b)`) must either be entered directly into Compass or recorded using the Association's official Joining Forms and then be transferred accurately into Compass (available from www.scouts.org.uk). The appropriate on-line or paper based criminal records disclosure check application process must then be followed.\ :sv:`#`

l. Section leaders should ensure that Occasional Helpers who are involved more than once a month are aware of the appointment opportunities available to them.

m. Members of Scout Network are required to undertake a Personal Enquiry without a criminal records disclosure check (by being added to Compass as a member of the relevant District Scout Network). If members of Scout Network assist with or supervise members of a younger Section, they must be appointed to an appropriate role (such as an Occasional Helper, Section Assistant or Leader) and undertake the relevant appointment process (including undertaking a criminal records disclosure check).

If the annual gross income or expenditure is above the limits laid down in the factsheet Accounting and Audit Requirements for Group, Districts, Counties/Areas and Scottish Regions the statement of accounts must be in the form of a Statement of Financial Activities (SOFA) with balance sheet. The factsheet is available from `www.scouts.org.uk <https://members.scouts.org.uk/supportresources/3265/accounting-and-reporting-requirements?cat=419,55,261,395>`__.
