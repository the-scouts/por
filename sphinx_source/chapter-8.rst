.. rule:: The Scout Association Legal Liability Policy
   :unnumbered:

This policy, incorporating Public Liability and Property Owners Liability, covers The Scout Association and may, at its request, provide cover for Commissioners, Leaders and other persons authorised to be in charge of, or to assist with, Scout activities against claims made by members under their control, or their parents/guardians, or by third parties, alleging legal liability arising out of accidents or incidents occurring during any authorised Scout activity and fundraising events. This is covered by the Public Liability section.

This policy covers the liability which rests upon any Scout authority which owns or is responsible for land and/or buildings (except for liability under any agreement). This is covered by the Property Owners Liability section.

It is a condition precedent to indemnity being granted by The Scout Association that any assistance required in investigating and/or defending any potential litigation will be given by those involved in the incident giving rise to the claim.

The Scout Association Legal Liability Policy does not cover legal liability arising out of the ownership and/or driving/piloting of motor vehicles, aircraft and/or gliders where compulsory third party insurance is required. If you are unsure whether you require additional insurance, contact Unity.

It does not fully cover liability for injuries to third parties and/or damage to third party property arising out of the ownership or operation of boats.

`Unity <https://www.unityinsuranceservices.co.uk/scout-insurance>`__ can arrange marine liability insurance and will provide details on application.

The provision of any indemnity given by The Scout Association is subject to the terms and conditions of any legal liability insurance policy which may be in force.
