:Chapter: 5
:Title: THE SCOUT COUNTY

Scouting in the United Kingdom is organised in Scout Groups, Scout Districts, Scout Counties and Country Headquarters. These 'units' of Scouting provide:

* support;
* channels for communication;
* opportunities for youth Members and Leaders to make decisions and take responsibility;
* functional units through which the design and delivery of the programme can be best achieved;

A Scout County normally comprises several Scout Districts. However, some Counties, in effect, have no Districts -- in these cases the County takes on the responsibilities of the District, including the District Executive Committee.

Additionally, the County may have one or more County Scout Active Support Units. In exceptional circumstances where District Scout Networks are not feasible, the County may have one County Scout Network which should follow the rules and guidance of a District Scout Network.

d. Every effort should be made to find a County Chair. Only in extreme circumstances may the County Commissioner act as County Chair for a short period.

e. The County Secretary---unless employed by the County---is elected by the County Scout Council at the Annual General Meeting every year.

The enquiries must include a Personal Enquiry to Headquarters, and certain roles require a criminal records disclosure check as part of the Personal Enquiry process (see the Safeguarding Policy and POR: The Appointment Process).

b. A Personal Enquiry (including where relevant a criminal records disclosure check) will always be required for any person aged 18 or over who meets **any** of the following criteria:\ :sv:`#`

   * wishes to become a Member or Associate member (for members of Scout Network -- see :rule:`5.19(m)` below); or
   * will be a member of an Executive Committee; or
   * will be assisting with overnight activities (including Nights Away); or
   * may be helping out once a week (or on four occasions in a thirty day period) or more frequently; or
   * will have unsupervised access to young people.

c. For the purposes of :rule:`5.19(b)` above 'unsupervised' means not being within sight and hearing of another adult who holds a valid criminal records disclosure check.

d. A person who requires a Personal Enquiry under :rule:`5.19(b)` above (including where relevant a criminal records disclosure check) and who does not have an active role on Compass must be registered on Compass as an Occasional Helper. Occasional Helpers are not entitled to membership status or member benefits (including certain insurances -- see the Unity web site) and the recording on Compass is only provided to enable the Personal Enquiry and criminal records disclosure checks to be conducted.\ :sv:`#`

e. Certain roles will require a criminal records disclosure check every five years.

f. A new criminal records disclosure check is not normally required if the individual is simply moving from one role to another within England and Wales; or within Northern Ireland; or within Scotland, provided the procedures have been followed for the initial role, that they have a valid criminal records disclosure check and the person's service has been continuous. However, depending on the result of previous enquiries a further Personal Enquiry may be required.

g. Where roles requiring a criminal records disclosure check (see POR: The Appointment Process) are held in more than one legal jurisdiction (i.e. England and Wales; Scotland; Northern Ireland) separate criminal records disclosure checks must be carried out in all the jurisdictions in which those roles are held.

h. A Personal Enquiry is initiated by adding the appropriate role to Compass. This should be done as soon as the individual concerned has agreed to take on a role.

i. When completing a Personal enquiry accurate information about the individual must be given.

j. The full rules for the appointment of adults can be found in POR: The Appointment Process.

k. Occasional Helpers (including parents) who are required to undertake a Personal Enquiry (see :rule:`5.19(a)` and :rule:`5.19(b)`) must either be entered directly into Compass or recorded using the Association's official Adult Information Form and then be transferred accurately into Compass (form available from https://www.scouts.org.uk/volunteers/running-things-locally/recruiting-and-managing-volunteers/appointing/appointment-forms/). The appropriate criminal records disclosure check application process must then be followed.\ :sv:`#`

l. Section leaders should ensure that Occasional Helpers who are involved more than once a month are aware of the appointment opportunities available to them.

m. Members of Scout Network are required to undertake a Personal Enquiry without a criminal records disclosure check (by being added to Compass as a member of the relevant District Scout Network). If members of Scout Network assist with or supervise members of a younger Section, they must be appointed to an appropriate role (such as an Occasional Helper, Section Assistant or Leader) and undertake the relevant appointment process (including undertaking a criminal records disclosure check).
