Appointments
------------
+---------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Appointment**                 | An adult role in Scouting which requires the adult appointment process as laid out in this document to be followed.                                                                                                                                                                                             |
+---------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Pre-provisional Appointment** | A new role starts with the status of Pre-Provisional Appointment. The Pre-Provisional status completes when the Personal and criminal records disclosure checks, References, Meeting with Appointment Panel and the Appointment Secretary has updated Compass to reflect the outcomes. (See Rule 4.5 f and g).  |
+---------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Provisional Appointment**     | When the Pre-provisional stage of an appointment is complete, the role status will change to Provisional if the Getting Started stage of training (if required for the role) is not complete.                                                                                                                   |
+---------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Full Appointment**            | For any role, once the Pre-Provisional and Provisional stages of the appointment are complete then the role will move to status Full.                                                                                                                                                                           |
+---------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Roles
-----
**SECTION LEADERSHIP TEAM ROLES**

A Drey, Colony, Pack, Troop or Unit will have a Section Leadership Team (see Rules 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, 3.10 and 4.7) comprising:

+-------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Section Leader**            | An adult responsible for the supervision, planning and delivery of the programme for the Drey, Colony, Pack, Troop or Unit and the management of the Section. It is possible for this to be a role shared between two or more volunteers. |
+-------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Assistant Section Leaders** | One or more adults appointed to assist the Section Leader in all aspects of the role. It is good practice, but not necessary, to have one or more Assistant Section Leaders.                                                              |
+-------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Section Assistants**        | One or more adults who assist the Section Leader in planning and delivering programmes to young people in the Movement.                                                                                                                   |
+-------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Additionally, a Drey, Colony, Pack, Troop or Unit may use Helpers to assist delivery of the Section's programme:

+-------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Helpers** | Additional adults (for example parents or subject experts from the community) may be used on a regular or occasional basis to support the delivery of programme. The Personal Enquiry and criminal records disclosures checks requirements detailed in Rule 3.27(b), 4.28(b) and 5.19(f) must apply wherever applicable for these adults. A person who requires a Personal Enquiry (including where relevant a criminal records disclosure check) [Rules 3.27, 4.28, 5.19] and who does not have an active role on Compass that includes a criminal records check must be registered on Compass as an Occasional Helper SV. This Occasional Helper role on Compass is not otherwise part of the Appointment Process, carries no membership status and is only provided to enable the Personal Enquiry and criminal records disclosure checks to be conducted if required by Rules 3.27, 4.28 and 5.19. |

The Appointment Process Overview
--------------------------------
a. **Purpose:** The purpose of the appointment process is to ensure that all those adults that the Movement accepts as volunteers:

   i. are appropriate persons to volunteer with The Scout Association;
   ii. are appropriate for the roles they are undertaking; and
   iii. fully accept the responsibilities of the roles and, where appropriate, the responsibilities of membership of The Scout Association.

b. **Principles:** The appointment process must be run so that:

   i. the applicant feels welcomed and not threatened by the appointment process;
   ii. the applicant is kept informed of progress through the appointment process;
   iii. the Association has robust assurance of appointing only appropriate people; and
   iv. the applicant takes a role that is appropriate to their skills, knowledge and attitude.

c. **Stages of appointment:** All adult appointments pass through four stages in the appointment process:

   <table border='"1"' cellpadding='"5"' width='"100%"'><tbody><tr><td>

Application

</td><td rowspan="3">

Induction

</td></tr><tr><td>

Approval

</td></tr><tr><td>

Appointment

</td></tr></tbody></table>

   i. **application:** where a line manager agrees to support an adult applying for an appointment and agrees a role description for that appointment;
   ii. **approval:** where independent checking concludes that the applicant is suitable for an appointment and includes agreement from the relevant Commissioner or body, successful outcome of the Personal Enquiry and, where appropriate, taking up two references;
   iii. **appointment:** where the relevant Commissioner or body makes the appointment; and iv. induction: where the line manager ensures that the adult receives a high-quality induction (this stage starts from the application process and runs for some time after the appointment is made).

d. **Roles in the appointment process:** the following roles are undertaken in the appointment process:

   i. **line manager:** the line manager (as detailed in table 2: Appointments) is responsible for recommending the applicant for the appointment. Only appointments that are listed in Table 2: Appointments may be recommended. The line manager should ensure that the volunteer has the skills, knowledge and the drive to be great in the proposed role.
   ii. **approver:** the appointment is approved by the relevant Commissioner (on the recommendation of the Appointments Advisory Committee), by the relevant Executive Committee or by the relevant Scout Council according to the appointment being made. The details of who may approve each appointment are given in Table 2: Appointments.
   iii. **relevant Commissioner/body:** the relevant Commissioner, the relevant Executive Committee or the relevant electoral body with the responsibility for making the appointment. Details of who the relevant Commissioner/body is for each role are given in Table 2: Appointments.

The Appointment Advisory Committee
----------------------------------

Appointing the Appointments Advisory Committee
----------------------------------------------
a. An Appointments Advisory Committee is mandatory for each District and each County/Area/ Region (Scotland) and primarily exists to assist with the process of appointing adults in Scouting.

b. The following members of the Appointments Advisory Committee are appointed by a resolution of the relevant Executive Committee:

   i. **Appointments Chair**: The Appointments Chair is appointed to lead the Appointments Advisory Committee. The Appointments Chair must not be the Chair of the relevant Executive Committee (because the Chair of the Executive Committee is involved in the resolutions of disputes involving the Appointments Advisory Committee).
   ii. **Appointments Secretary**: The Secretary is appointed to ensure that the required administration is carried out for the Appointments Advisory Committee.
   iii. **Appointments Members**: Sufficient members must be appointed to ensure that three members can be found to undertake the meeting with each applicant.

c. In appointing the members of the Appointments Advisory Committee, the Executive Committee should bear in mind the range of skills and attributes that will be required in committee members. All members of the Appointments Advisory Committee must be over 18 years old. Every Appointments Advisory Committee should have, as members, at least two young people between the age of 18 and 25 years old. (`Rules 4.25c <https://www.scouts.org.uk/por/4-the-scout-district/rule-425-the-constitution-of-the-scout-district/>`__ and `5.16c <https://www.scouts.org.uk/por/5-the-scout-county/rule-516-the-constitution-of-the-scout-county/>`__). `Rule 2.2(d) <https://www.scouts.org.uk/por/2-key-policies/rule-21-responsibilities-within-the-equal-opportunities-policy/>`__ must also be observed.

   Appointments Advisory Committee members do not require to have current or previous experience in Scouting.

d. All members of the Appointments Advisory Committee must have successfully completed a Personal Enquiry.

e. Districts and Counties/Areas/Regions (Scotland) may choose to share an Appointments Advisory Committee so long as:

   i. each Executive Committee involved agrees to sharing an Appointments Advisory Committee which must be recorded by resolution of each Executive Committee;
   ii. each Executive Committee involved has an Appointments Secretary appointed to carry out the role on behalf of that Executive Committee (an individual may act as Appointments Secretary for more than one Executive Committee if agreed by the individual and the relevant Executive Committees);
   iii. each Executive Committee involved agrees the appointment of the Appointments Chair and the other members of the Appointments Advisory Committee; and
   iv. the Appointments Chair of the Appointments Advisory Committee is not the Chair of any Executive Committee on whose behalf the Appointments Advisory Committee acts.

f. Districts and Counties/Areas/Regions (Scotland) may have more than one Appointments Advisory Committee so long as:

   i. each Appointments Advisory Committee is appointed by the relevant Executive Committee according to (b) above; and
   ii. each Appointments Advisory Committee has a clearly defined responsibility for appointments (for example, by geographical area or type of appointment) which must be recorded by resolution of the relevant Executive Committee.

Training Requirements for Appointments Advisory Committee Members sv
--------------------------------------------------------------------
a. The Appointments Chair, Appointments Secretary and other members of the Appointments Advisory Committee must show that they are competent to carry out this important role of checking potential new adult volunteers in The Scout Association. It is therefore mandatory that members meet certain validation criteria that are defined in The Scout Association's adult training scheme and complete Module 1 Essential Information, Safety, Safeguarding, GDPR and Module 37 Advising on Adult Appointments. Note that for an Appointment Panel it is good practice that the Panel members are fully validated against their training obligations.

b. As the line manager, the Appointments Chair is responsible for ensuring that all members of the Appointments Advisory Committee have completed the required modules. The Appointments Chair, however, does not necessarily have to be the Training Adviser for the Appointments Advisory Committee members. The Appointments Chair should work closely with the County/Area Training Manager/Assistant Regional Commissioner Adult Training (Scotland) or the Local Training Manager (according to local arrangements) to co-ordinate the allocation of appropriately skilled Training Advisers to ensure the validation of each role holder.

Duties of the Appointments Advisory Committee sv
------------------------------------------------
a. The Appointments Advisory Committee is responsible for the following areas:

   i. Appointment Panels: meeting with new adults or existing adults who have changed role to assess whether they are aware of and willing to uphold the current values and policies of The Scout Association and whether they understand the requirements of the role and are able to carry them out.
   ii. Appointment Reviews: supporting the review process, considering (with the line manager) the outcome of a review.
   iii. Suspensions: on request following the local suspension of an adult, recommending continuation of suspension, re-instatement, modification or cancellation of an appointment.
   iv. Complaints: on request, taking part in the resolution of complaints from applicants regarding the outcome of the appointment process; and
   v. Cancellations: on request, considering together with the Commissioner recommendations to end appointments and/or a person's involvement in Scouting as a result of disagreements between adults.

Once the Appointment Process is complete, the relevant Commissioner and the relevant Line Manager should receive a recommendation from the Appointments Advisory Committee. The recommendation will be to appoint, or not -- in either case with a short statement/reason.

The Appointment Panel Meeting
-----------------------------
a. The local Appointments Advisory Committee may agree that there are some roles or circumstances when candidates will not be required to meet with an Appointment Panel. It is expected that an Appointment Panel will normally meet with persons new to Scouting in the County or District. But Appointments Advisory Committees may, for example, choose to not normally have an Appointment Panel meet with a person changing from Section Leader to Assistant Section Leader in the same Section, or an Explorer Scout Young Leader taking on a Section Assistant role when they reach the age of 18.

   Similarly, if an Appointment Advisory Panel has recently met the applicant for another appointment, the committee may decide not to meet the applicant again.

   It is good governance practice for the whole Appointments Advisory Committee to discuss their implementation of local Panel arrangements, to agree their proposals with their parent Executive Committee, and to reconfirm (with updates if required) with their parent Executive Committee on an annual basis.

b. The decision to meet with candidates (or not) is entirely one for the Appointments Advisory Committee to make.

c. To balance the need for a suitably rigorous selection process and the need for a welcoming and non-threatening process, exactly three members of the Appointments Advisory Committee (the Appointment Panel) will be required to determine an applicant's appropriateness for an appointment by meeting with the applicant. It is good practice for a member of the Panel to be aged under 25, and for the Panel to have an 'equal opportunities' mix of membership, including a current practitioner in a 'programme' role. Except in cases specifically agreed in advance with the Appointments Chair, a Panel meets with only one applicant at one time

d. In some circumstances, the Appointments Chair may allow one additional person to be present at the meeting, for example if Module 37 is being validated, or if the applicant needs an interpreter/signer to attend the meeting.

e. The line manager of the applicant is not allowed to be a member of the Appointment Panel that meets the applicant, nor can the applicant's line manager be present at any such meeting (so if an interpreter/signer is required for (e) above then that role may not be undertaken by the applicant's line manager).

f. The Appointment Panel members will assess the following areas:

   i. **Values and policies:** that the applicant is aware of and accepts (and by personal example is prepared to uphold and promote) the values and policies of The Scout Association -- including confirming the applicant's willingness to make and live by the Scout Promise if applying for a Member role (as defined in Table 2: Appointments).
   ii. **Role:** that the applicant understands the requirements of the role and is able and willing to carry it out.

The purpose of the Appointment Panel is restricted to these two topics.

The Panel meeting role does not include consideration of the outcomes of Personal Enquiry or references.

Other matters for the Appointments Advisory Committee
-----------------------------------------------------
a. When the Appointments Advisory Committee is asked to consider or make decisions on any of the following:

   i. whether to appoint when there are unsatisfactory references
   ii. whether to appoint when there is an unsatisfactory personal enquiry
   iii. the outcome following a local suspension process
   iv. the outcome of Appointment Reviews
   v. the outcome of complaints regarding the appointment or review process,

      three members of the Appointments Advisory Committee should meet to consider the issues. The Appointments Chair is the person responsible for selecting these members, ensuring a fair and independent panel is formed. It is good practice for a member of the Panel to be aged under 25, and for the Panel to have an 'equal opportunities' mix of membership, including a current practitioner in a 'programme' role.

Making Appointments
-------------------

Personal Enquiry
----------------
a. No person aged 18 or over may be permitted to undertake any responsibilities or involvement within Scouting until the appropriate enquiries have been made. `See POR Rules 3.26 <https://www.scouts.org.uk/por/3-the-scout-group/327-the-appointment-of-adults/>`__, `4.28 <https://www.scouts.org.uk/por/4-the-scout-district/rule-428-the-appointment-of-adults-in-the-scout-district/>`__ and `5.19 <https://www.scouts.org.uk/por/5-the-scout-county/rule-519-the-appointment-of-adults-in-the-scout-county-sv/>`__.

   This personal enquiry may include a criminal records check -- the roles that require a criminal records check are detailed in Table 2: Appointments.

b. An adult may not have any involvement in Scouting where a current report from an appropriate professional or statutory source suggests that the individual is not an appropriate person to hold a position in Scouting.

c. All reasonable practicable steps must be taken to ensure that those appointed to a role in Scouting are appropriate persons.

d. In all cases of doubt concerning the suitability of an individual the District, County or Regional (Scotland) Commissioner (as appropriate) and the Appointments Advisory Committee must err on the side of caution and not approve an appointment. The welfare and safety of young people must be the overriding factor.

Age Limits
----------
a. The minimum age for all appointments is 18.

b. There is no maximum age for appointments, with the exception of Youth Commissioner appointments. Please see `Rule 4.44f (iii) <https://www.scouts.org.uk/por/4-the-scout-district/rule-444-responsibilities-of-appointments-in-the-scout-district-sv/>`__ and `Rule 5.35j (iii) <https://www.scouts.org.uk/por/5-the-scout-county/rule-535-responsibilities-of-appointments-in-the-scout-county/>`__ for details.

Membership of the Movement
--------------------------
a. Some roles require the applicant to become a Member of the Movement (`see Rules 3.1 <https://www.scouts.org.uk/por/3-the-scout-group/31-membership-of-the-scout-group/>`__, `4.1 <https://www.scouts.org.uk/por/4-the-scout-district/rule-41-membership-of-the-scout-district/>`__, `5.1 <https://www.scouts.org.uk/por/5-the-scout-county/rule-51-membership-of-the-scout-county/>`__). These roles are indicated in *Table 2: Appointments* under the "Membership" column as "Member".

b. Some roles require the applicant to become an Associate Member of the Movement `(see Rules 3.1 <https://www.scouts.org.uk/por/3-the-scout-group/31-membership-of-the-scout-group/>`__, `4.1 <https://www.scouts.org.uk/por/4-the-scout-district/rule-41-membership-of-the-scout-district/>`__, `5.1 <https://www.scouts.org.uk/por/5-the-scout-county/rule-51-membership-of-the-scout-county/>`__). These roles are indicated in *Table 2: Appointments* under the "Membership" column as "Associate Member". In these cases, the applicant may choose to become a Member if they wish.

c. The Appointments Advisory Committee must maintain a local process that tracks such choices to change membership status -- if not recorded by the Appointments Secretary on behalf of the Appointments Advisory Committee then the membership status must be assumed to be that recorded for the role in *Table 2: Appointments*.

Charity Trustees
----------------
a. All applicants proposed (by nomination or election) for roles that carry charity trustee responsibility (see Table 2: Appointments) must be eligible to be a charity trustee. It is the responsibility of the line manager as defined in Table 2: Appointments to ensure that the applicant is aware of and conforms to this requirement.
b. The roles of Chair, Treasurer and Secretary may not be held by Leaders, Managers or Supporters where that could lead to any real or potential conflict of interest within the charity or directly related charities. For example a Section Leader should not be a Group Treasurer in the same Scout Group or a District Treasurer, but could be Group Treasurer in a different Scout Group (subject to having the time and skill to undertake both roles). Note Rules 3.25d, 4.26d, 5.17d.

The Procedure for Making Appointments
-------------------------------------
There are three processes used in the making of appointments. The relevant process for each role is shown in Table 2: Appointments.

**Process 1:** Roles that are appointed using the Appointment Process managed by the relevant Appointments Advisory Committee

When the relevant line manager wishes to appoint any adult to a new role that is subject to the AAC process, Process 1 in the table below must take place.

**Process 2:** Roles that are appointed by the relevant Scout Council at their Annual General Meeting

When the relevant electoral body has at its AGM elected a member of the Executive Committee or agreed the nomination of a member to the Executive Committee, Process 2 in the table below must take place.

**Process 3:** Roles that are appointed by the relevant Executive Committee.

When the relevant Executive Committee has appointed a role within its authority, Process 3 in the table below must take place.

**Process 4:** Roles that are appointed by UK Headquarters.

| b) Within 30 days of the application, election or nomination to a role, the applicant's line manager must initiate a Personal Enquiry, including a criminal records check if indicated as required in Table 2: Appointments. Note that a criminal records check is also required for persons who have access to records (paper or electronic) containing personal details of young persons. (If necessary, the Occasional Helper role on Compass can be used in these cases.)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Yes           | Yes           | Yes           | Yes                                                                                                                                     |

| c) For all new roles, or role changes, the applicant must be made aware, by the relevant line manager, of the:a. Fundamentals of Scouting (POR Chapter 1)b. Key policies of Scouting (POR Chapter 2)c. Responsibilities and commitments of the appointment (these are listed on the Declarations page of the Adult Information Form)d. Our Safeguarding Code of Behaviour [Young People First---Safeguarding -- a code of practice (informally known as the 'Yellow card')]e. Training obligations of the appointment; andf. The procedure for the appointment of adults.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Yes           | Yes           | Yes           | Yes                                                                                                                                     |

| d) For an adult new to Scouting, a new record must be set up on Compass. The Appointments Advisory Committee will define the local process, but normal practice will be for the line manager or their nominee to enter the adult's details into Compass. The Adult Information Form may be a useful method for the adult to gather all necessary information, though it can be entered directly online.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Yes           | Yes           | Yes           | Yes                                                                                                                                     |

| e) For all new roles, or role changes, the role should be added to the adult's Compass record. Any roles being closed should be updated at the same time. The Appointments Advisory Committee will define the local process, but normal practice will be for the line manager (or a local Administrator) to enter the adult's role details into Compass.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Yes           | Yes           | Yes           | Yes                                                                                                                                     |

| f) There then follow three process components that must be undertaken. Each of these process components must be complete within a maximum of 5 months from the Role Start Date on Compass. The three process elements can---and should---be undertaken in parallel with each other.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| f1) **Personal and criminal records enquiry.**  This rule 4.5(f1) only applies to roles needing a Criminal Records Disclosure Check. Table 2: Appointments shows whether a role needs a Criminal Records Disclosure Check. If the applicant is being re-elected or re-nominated without any break in service then a new Personal Enquiry is not required, unless it has been five years since the last Personal Enquiry when a further criminal record check is required. Otherwise, the line manager should initiate a personal and criminal records enquiry via Compass and the appropriate country process. The Appointments Advisory Committee can consider this step complete when it is recorded as such on Compass. Headquarters will, if necessary, contact the relevant Commissioner during this process. Until the Personal and Criminal Enquiries are complete, the applicant must not have any unsupervised access to young people (unsupervised access is defined in POR Rules 3.27c, 4.28c, 5.19c).                           | Yes           | Yes           | Yes           | Yes                                                                                                                                     |

| f2) **References** If the applicant's character and background are not known (as determined by the Appointments Advisory Committee), or if the applicant is returning to Scouting after a period of absence, the Appointments Secretary must obtain at least two references in writing (using form RF or using Compass).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Yes           | No            | No            | No This is addressed through the UKHQ appointment search process                                                                        |

| f3) **Meeting with Appointment Panel** The Appointments Secretary must arrange for the applicant to meet with an Appointments Panel, in line with rule 3.4 in this chapter, as soon as possible. The Appointments Secretary will make the information on Compass available to the Appointment Panel prior to the meeting with the applicant. Note that the contents of criminal records check disclosures, and of any references, are not part of the Panel meeting. When the Appointment Panel has met with the applicant, it will inform the Appointments Secretary of its recommendation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Yes           | No            | No            | No This is addressed through the UK HQ appointment search process.

| g) Once the process elements in (f) above are complete the Appointments Secretary must update Compass to reflect the outcomes. If all three elements are satisfactory then the Responsible Commissioner should be asked for approval. Once that approval is recorded on Compass the appointment will automatically move to Provisional status (or, if Getting Started training is already complete, will move direct to Full status). If references or the Appointment Panel meeting have raised any doubts about the suitability of the candidate, then the Appointments Chair should be advised by the Appointments Secretary. The Appointments Chair will consult in confidence [see 3.5 above] with up to 2 other Appointments Advisory Committee members (and the referee(s) if required), to make a final recommendation to the relevant Commissioner, who makes the final decision on appointment. If the outcome is to not appoint then details of the reason must be recorded on Compass using the End Role Unsatisfactorily option. | Yes           | No            | No            | Yes In this case the changes are made by the HQ Appointments Secretary                                                                  |

| h) Once the requisite Getting Started training (see Table 2: Appointments) is recorded on Compass by the adult's Training Adviser, and the appointment process is complete, the appointment will move to Full status. This must be completed within a period of five months from the role start date recorded on Compass                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Yes           | Yes           | Yes           | Yes                                                                                                                                     |

| i) Once the appointment has reached Full status, an appointment certificate can be issued if that is agreed local practice and presented to the applicant by the District, County or Regional (Scotland) (as appropriate). [Note: Your Role in Scouting certificates can be created via the Brand Centre.] Adults who are to become Members of The Scout Association should be invested by their line manager (or nominee) and make or reaffirm the Scout Promise. [Note: Associate Members are not required to make the Promise (Rule 3.1(t)]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Yes           | Yes           | Yes           | Yes                                                                                                                                     |

| j) If the District, County, Area or Regional (Scotland) Commissioner (as appropriate) does not accept the conclusion of the Appointments Advisory Committee, the application must be considered and reviewed by the Chair of the relevant District, County or Regional (Scotland) Executive Committee. The Executive Committee Chair's decision is final.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Yes           | n/a           | n/a           | n/a                                                                                                                                     |

| I) Working with the applicant and the appropriate Training Adviser, it is the responsibility of the line manager to ensure that the applicant meets all training obligations appropriate to the role.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Yes           | Yes           | Yes           | Yes                                                                                                                                     |

Pre-Provisional and Provisional Appointments
--------------------------------------------
a. Pre-Provisional and Provisional Appointments allow an adult volunteer to start getting involved in their new role whilst completing the appointment process.

   A new role starts as a Pre-Provisional Appointment and this completes when the Appointments process is complete.

   If the Getting Started training requirements have not been completed by the time that the Appointments process is complete, then the role status will change from pre-Provisional to a Provisional Appointment.

During the period of Pre-Provisional and Provisional Appointment the relevant Getting Started training modules must be completed as detailed in Table 2: Appointments. These modules can be undertaken in parallel with the Appointment processes listed in this chapter.

b. It is required that roles reach Full status within 5 months from the start date of the role as recorded on Compass.

c. If the applicant's role has not reached Full status within 5 months then appropriate restrictions must be applied to the appointment [see Rule 7a] or the appointment must be cancelled by the District Commissioner, County/Area or Regional (Scotland) Commissioner (or their nominee) using the 'end role' facility on Compass.

d. Ultimate responsibility for ensuring that the Pre-Provisional and Provisional Appointment stages are successfully completed, including ensuring that minimum safety standards are met, rests with the line manager (see *Table 2: Appointments*) during the Pre-Provisional and Provisional Appointment periods.

Full Appointments
-----------------
a. An Appointment will move to status Full when an adult has satisfactorily completed the appointment process (4.5(f)) and any Getting Started processes defined in Table 2: Appointments.
b. Adults holding an appointment (from Table 2) who have completed the necessary personal enquiries and their appointment is at status Full may have unsupervised access to young people in accordance with the Safeguarding Policy. Other adults may have unsupervised access to young people on regulated activities provided they have completed the necessary personal enquiries (see POR Rules 3.27(b), 4.28(b) and 5.19(b)).
c. Any appointment may, in exceptional circumstances, be refused by Headquarters.

Induction
---------
a. The person specified in the column entitled "Responsible for Induction" in Table 2: Appointments will ensure that the applicant is given a full induction into the role starting when the applicant has agreed to apply for the appointment.

Training
--------
a. All appointed adults must undertake the training as specified in the columns headed "Getting Started" and "Training Obligations" in Table 2: Appointments. Training listed in the "Getting Started" column must be complete (recorded on Compass) before an appointment can move to Full status.

b. For those appointed adults that must complete a Wood Badge (as listed in the "Training Obligations" column of Table 2: Appointments), if it is not completed within three years of the role start date recorded on Compass, appropriate restrictions must be applied to the appointment [see Rule 7a] or the appointment must be ended by the relevant District, County or Regional (Scotland) Commissioner.

c. In order to facilitate a smooth transition for the use of mutually agreed restrictions in relation to wood badge training, we are advising that commissioners put in place an action plan to allow volunteers to complete this training before September 2021. More information is available at: https://www.scouts.org.uk/volunteers/running-things-locally/recruiting-and-managing-volunteers/tools-for-managing-volunteers/mutually-agreed-restrictions/

d. All role holders, must meet their Getting Started and/or Training obligations as defined in POR The appointment process chapter, rule Table 2: Appointments.

   If training is not completed within 5 months of the role start date recorded on Compass, appropriate restrictions must be applied to the appointment [see Rule 7a] or the appointment must be cancelled by the relevant District, County or Regional (Scotland) Commissioner.
e. There are obligations for on-going training. These are:

   **Safeguarding.** Required by all roles as detailed in *Table 2: Appointments.* Safeguarding training must be completed within 5 months of role start date as part of Getting Started/ introduction training. Thereafter, for as long as the adult is in a role that requires the training, it must after it must be undertaken again no later than 3 years after their last recorded Safeguarding training completion date on Compass.

   **Safety.** Required by all roles as detailed in *Table 2: Appointments.* Safety training must be completed within 5 months of the role start date as part of Getting Started/ introduction training. Thereafter, for as long as the adult is in a role that requires the training, it must be undertaken again no later than 3 years after their last recorded Safety training completion date on Compass.

   **First Aid.** Required by all roles recorded in Table 2: Appointments as requiring a Wood Badge. First Aid training must be completed within 3 years of the role start date recorded on Compass. Thereafter, for as long as the adult is in a role that requires a Wood Badge, the training must be undertaken again no later than 3 years after the last recorded First Aid training completion date on Compass.

   Note that all adults in roles (other than Trustee roles) are encouraged to gain a first aid certificate (minimum of First Response) and then to renew it every three years.
   **GDPR.** All role holders in roles requiring Module 1 must also have completed GDPR training within 5 months of their role start date.

   **GDPR.** All role holders in roles requiring Module 1 must also have completed GDPR training within 5 months of their role start date.

If on-going training is not completed within the timescales set out above, appropriate restrictions could be applied to the appointment [see Rule 7a] or the appointment must be cancelled by the relevant District, County or Regional (Scotland) Commissioner.

Reviewing Appointments
----------------------
a. It is good practice for line manager and role holder to hold an informal review meeting at least annually -- an opportunity to mutually take stock to celebrate successes and to plan for the future. It is also an opportunity to determine if the role holder has any additional training needs (including the required on-going training) and also to agree whether another role would be more suitable.

b. A 'formal' Appointment Review normally takes place during the final 6 months of an appointment (though can be convened by either the line manager or the role holder at any time). A key outcome of this meeting will include an agreement over whether the individual's appointment should be renewed, whether they should take on a different role, or whether they will leave Scouting. It is good practice for line manager and role holder to agree the approximate first review date at the start of a role and record that on Compass.

c. The purpose of the review is therefore to determine whether:

   i. the appointment is to continue for another period; or
   ii. the appointment is to be ended; or
   iii. the adult will apply for a different role.

Although the determination should be agreed between the appointee and their line manager, ultimately the line manager makes the decision whether to Reappoint, Reassign or Retire the appointee.

d. Unless indicated differently in Table 2: Appointments, the appointee's line manager is responsible for ensuring that the formal Review is conducted during the final 6 months of an appointment (or earlier if required by the relevant Commissioner).

On-going training requirements must be monitored at the point of each 'formal' Appointment Review.

e. The line manager has a responsibility to ensure timely Appointment Reviews are held (see (b) above). The Appointments Secretary should support the Appointment Review process and should maintain an oversight of the Appointment Review process in the County/District. Roles requiring Appointment Review are listed in Table 2: Appointments.

Line managers (unless otherwise stated in Table 2: Appointments) should schedule an Appointment Review to be held no later than the 'next review date' recorded on Compass [if no such date is recorded than it must take place no later than 5 years after the role start date or 5 years after the previous Appointment Review].

f. It is good practice to schedule the meeting 3 months in advance. However, where an earlier Appointment Review is requested (by line manager or appointment holder or the relevant Commissioner) then a shorter notice period is acceptable, though there must be at least two weeks' notice except in the most exceptional circumstances. During an Appointment Review the person carrying out the review will record the details on Form AR (including the recommended outcome of the review) and pass the completed form to the Appointments Secretary.

g. The Appointments Advisory Committee (note 3.5 above) and the relevant District, County, Area or Regional (Scotland) Commissioner together consider the completed Form AR and reach a decision on the review of the appointment. The purpose of this meeting is to ensure that an appropriate Appointment Review process has been followed, and that the recommended outcomes are being actioned.

h. The Appointments Secretary is informed and records the decision. The Appointment Secretary must also update Compass appropriately (if not already updated by the line manager), including recording the date for the next Appointment Review (if required).

i. The following table gives details of the line manager for each appointment who will carry out the
Appointment Review:

b. On the appointment of a County Commissioner, all appointments held at County level (including those of District Commissioners) will be subject to review. The review must be completed within six months of the County Commissioner's appointment.

   NOTE: In a County/Area that has no Districts then the appointments at (l) below should be treated as County appointments.

c. On the appointment of a District Commissioner, all appointments held at District level including Explorer Scout Leaders, Scout Network Leaders and Group Scout Leaders will be subject to review.

   The reviews must be completed within six months of the District Commissioner's appointment.

Ceasing to hold an Appointment
------------------------------
a. An appointee may resign an appointment by notifying the relevant line manager listed in Table 2: Appointments. The appointee and the line manager will agree a final date for the role and the line manager will ensure that date is recorded on Compass.

b. On ceasing to hold an appointment, in the case of satisfactory service, the line manager or the Appointments Secretary will end the appointment on Compass.

c. In the case of an individual with satisfactory service who has resigned due to moving out of the District, County or Region (Scotland), the Appointments Secretary enters the adult's new address, if known and if agreed by the adult, on Compass.

d. If the adult's service has been unsatisfactory, Compass should be updated with full details. Alternatively, a Form CS can be completed and sent to Headquarters who will end the appointment. On receipt of the cancellation via Compass, or the Form CS, Headquarters may seek further information on the cancellation if necessary.

Cancellation of Membership or Ending of Appointments
----------------------------------------------------
a. The relevant Commissioner and the Appointments Chair, acting together, may end or not renew any appointment or cancel an adult's membership/Associate Membership [whether appointed to roles using process 1, 2 or 3 from Table 1: The Appointments Process in this chapter] on one or more of the following grounds:

   i. the appointee resigns when notified that a recommendation is to be made for the ending or non-renewal of an appointment
   ii. Unsatisfactory outcome of a Personal Enquiry and/or criminal records check
   iii. an appointment is not to be renewed following Appointment Review
   iv. the appointee has ceased or failed to perform the duties of an appointment satisfactorily
   v. it becomes evident that the appointee no longer accepts the fundamental principles of the Movement
   vi. it becomes evident that the appointee is not an appropriate person in respect of the Association's Policies and Rules
   vii. the adult has not met the training requirements of the role

        * the appointee has failed within the time limits satisfactorily to complete Adult Training appropriate to the appointment including the Getting Started and training obligations listed in Table 2: Appointments. For Trustee appointments, the appropriate Chair must be part of the decision process.
        * the adult does not hold a current first aid certificate (a minimum of First Response) if they hold an appointment that requires a Wood Badge;
        * the adult has not met their on-going training requirements, including safety and safeguarding. For Trustee appointments, the appropriate Chair must be part of the decision process.

   viii. the appointee has or is likely to bring the name of the Association into disrepute
   ix. the appointment should be ended following the closure of a Group, Explorer Scout Unit, District Scout Network or a Section.
   x. Appointments can be ended, or membership cancelled, by resolution of the Group, District or County Executive as appropriate. The appropriate Executive Committee shall be under no obligation to state its reasons for making such a resolution.
   xi. failure to observe the terms of any suspension imposed in accordance with POR Rule 15.2.

Ending or non-renewal of an appointment should be used where necessary, however the appropriate Commissioner may apply restrictions or suspension to ensure a volunteer rectifies issues. As example, this may be used to allow time for a volunteer to complete relevant training. Further information is available `here <https://www.scouts.org.uk/volunteers/running-things-locally/recruiting-and-managing-volunteers/suspensions/>`__

Although it is good practice to have discussions relating to ending appointments or cancelling membership in the framework of an Appointment Review, action may be taken without an Appointment Review where the responsible Commissioner and the responsible Commissioner's line manager agree that circumstances require it. In these cases the role holder must be advised of the reasons for the cancellation or non-renewal.

Notwithstanding any other means provided by these Rules, the Membership of any Member or Associate Member of the Movement may be cancelled by resolution of the Board of Trustees of the Scout Association. The Board shall be under no obligation to state its reasons for making such a resolution.

b. Additionally, in the case of provisional appointments, the relevant Commissioner and the Appointments Chair (who may seek advice from up to two other members of the Appointments Advisory Committee), acting together may end or not renew any appointment where: the appointee has failed to complete the requirements of the provisional appointment, even after a period of mutually agreed restrictions or suspension to enable completion.

c. In exceptional circumstances Headquarters may, after consultation with the relevant Commissioner, end or refuse to renew an appointment. The UK Chief Commissioner, or nominee, must ensure that appropriate processes and responsibilities are defined, agreed and implemented at Headquarters to enable this process to be appropriately and consistently applied.

d. Where a role is ended or membership/associate membership is cancelled under 7(a), 7(b) or 7(c) above, then the individual concerned must immediately give all assets and data that they hold relating to Scouting to their line manager (or line managers where a person holds more than one role).

Where a role is ended but membership/associate membership continues, this is in the context of that role only. Where membership/associate membership is cancelled, this is in the context of all roles held. Relevant commissioners and line managers must work together to ensure that all assets and data are given back.

This includes, but is not limited to:

* Youth and adult membership data that is held on paper
* Youth and adult membership data that is held that is held electronically
* Financial information and assets related to Scouting (for example, cash, cheque books, bank statements, passwords)
* Equipment or other physical resources held that are owned by a Scout unit
* Keys and any other security equipment or information held

After data is passed to the line manager, the ex-role holder or ex-member/associate member must destroy any copies they still retain.

Where role(s) that includes Trustee responsibilities are ended, these responsibilities cease on the role end date(s).

Resolving Disagreements
-----------------------
a. If there is a complaint from an applicant because an appointment has not been approved, the applicant may (provided invoked within 14 days of the non-approval):

   1. In the first instance, meet the Appointments Chair and another member of the Appointments Advisory Committee (preferably a member who has not been part of the approval meeting for the complainant). This meeting will allow the complainant to explain the problem and to see if an agreeable resolution can be found. For completeness, the conclusion of the meeting will be notified in writing to the complainant and the relevant Commissioner.

   2. If the complainant is still not satisfied after step 1, the complainant may make an appeal (within 14 days of receipt of the outcome of step 1) to the Chair of the Executive Committee that is the parent body of the Appointments Advisory Committee.

      The Executive Committee Chair may choose to ask a small number of members (not normally exceeding 3) of the Executive Committee (not involved in the appointment of the individual) to investigate the issue and provide a confidential report to the Executive Committee Chair, whose decision is final. Once step 2 has been completed, the complainant may not take the complaint any further.

b. If there is disagreement over any cancellation or ending (of roles or membership) under Appointments Process (section 7a) (whether or not as the outcome of an Appointment Review) the individual may only appeal against the process. Any appeal must be received within 14 days of the decision being notified to them:

   1. In the first instance, meet the Appointments Chair and another member of the Appointments Advisory Committee. The purpose of this meeting is to allow the complainant to explain the problem regarding the process and to see if an agreeable resolution can be found. For completeness, the conclusion of the meeting will be notified in writing to the complainant and the relevant Commissioner.

   2. If the complainant is still not satisfied after step 1, the complainant may make an appeal to the Chair of the Executive Committee that is the parent body of the Appointments Advisory Committee. Any such appeal must be received within 14 days of receipt of the written outcome of step 1.

      The Executive Committee Chair may choose to ask a small number of members (not normally exceeding 3) of the Executive Committee (not involved in the review process of the individual) to investigate the issue and provide a confidential report to the Executive Committee Chair, whose decision is final. The decision will be notified in writing to the complainant and the relevant Commissioner.

      Once step 2 has been completed, the complainant may not take the complaint any further.

c. The UK Chief Commissioner, or nominee, must ensure that appropriate processes are defined, agreed and implemented at Headquarters in case of disagreements related to implementation of 7(c).

Adult Volunteer Roles
---------------------
a. Scouting's activities are delivered or supported by adults in various roles. These roles are listed in Table 2 below. Only roles listed in Table 2 may be allocated on Compass -- Table 2 reflects all appointable roles that are available. All roles in Table 2 have Member/Associate Member status.
b. Several of the roles are governance roles. It is important in law that key governance roles -- Chair, Secretary and Treasurer -- are always filled. If a Chair, Secretary or Treasurer resigns during the period between AGMs, then the Executive Committee should appoint a member of the Executive Committee to the role, subject to approval by a majority of the members of the relevant Executive and (for the role of Chair) the appointing Commissioner (GSL, DC or CC as appropriate).

   i. If none of the Executive Committee members are able to take on the vacant Chair, Secretary or Treasurer role, then an appropriate person can be co-opted as an Executive Committee member, subject to the relevant rules elsewhere in POR (Rules 3.24 (b) (iii), 4.25 (f) (iii), 5.15 (f) (iii)), and the approval by a majority of the members of the relevant Executive and (for the role of Chair) the appointing Commissioner (GSL, DC or CC as appropriate).
   ii. Such appointments to the Chair, Secretary or Treasurer roles are valid only for the short-term, until the next Annual General Meeting. Note that there is no role of Acting Chair, Acting Secretary or Acting Treasurer available -- the process above must be followed to fill a short-term role until the next Annual General Meeting.

c. There are a set of people who provide informal support. These people are often referred to as Helpers. As stated in Rule 1.2 'Helpers'; Additional adults (for example parents or subject experts from the community) may be used to support the delivery of programme. The Personal Enquiry and criminal records disclosures checks requirements detailed in Rule 3.27(b), 4.28(b) and 5.19(f) must apply wherever applicable for these adults. A person who requires a Personal Enquiry (including where relevant a criminal records disclosure check) [Rules 3.27, 4.28, 5.19] and who does not have an active role on Compass that includes a criminal records disclosure check must be registered on Compass as an Occasional HelperSV. This Occasional Helper role on Compass is not otherwise part of the Appointment Process, carries no membership status and is only provided to enable the Personal Enquiry and criminal records disclosure checks to be conducted if required by Rules 3.27, 4.28 and 5.19. It is therefore not included in the Table 2 below. To obtain a criminal records disclosure the person must be recorded on Compass (as Occasional Helpers, or---in Scotland---as PVG--only, but this is not a 'role' and is simply a route to obtaining the necessary criminal records check disclosure.
d. Also included in Compass should be nominated, elected or co-opted Council members. This role is also not included in Table 2 because it is not a 'member' role but is rather a role that Members or Associate Members may acquire.
e. Certain staff members also require access to Compass and these roles are also recorded on Compass. Again, these roles are not recorded in Table 2.
